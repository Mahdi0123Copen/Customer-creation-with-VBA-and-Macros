# Customer-creation-with-VBA-and-Macros
This was a project for an exam, where i had to make a customer order on excel and automate the process with VBA and Macro. After the order was typed it was going to see if the input was valid by checking if the product they requested was in storage. If the product was in storage their order would be accepted, otherwise not accepted. If it was accepted, the amount ordered would be subtracted from the storage. Also after making the order it would also update the revenue made from each of the products
